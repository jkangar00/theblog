                    It’s a small cafe very clean and quiet. Definitely like a hidden gem study cafe. They have minimal seating but enough space where it’s not claustrophobic. There’s seating where you can see outside, so you can bask in the sun while you enjoy your drink without too much disturbance.

            <h3>Flavor</h3>
                <p>
                    The drink has a floral fragrant like jasmine and the taste is not a typical matcha flavor. It taste more like a jasmine iced tea, especially the after taste. Not something I’ve had before nor am particularly fond of. But despite that, the more you drink it the better the matcha flavor gets. I think it’s an acquired taste but I like it more as you drink it. It’s watered down too and no strong oat flavor. Overall very unique matcha flavor. You’ll like it if you’re fond of jasmine tea or tea in general.

            <h3 id="tex">Texture</h3>
                <p>
                    The texture is thin and smooth. It has a dry finish. There are no particles or granular texture which is a good sign. The tea used makes the drink very refreshing.

                The cafe is very accessible and close to many stores where you can get another bite to eat. It is right behind campus as well. There were some artisan pastries available a small selection of other drinks to get. Since its on a busy street it has a lot of outside noise but very good for an after school pick up. The color is a bit of an off green, muted and brown. It comes solid without a gradient and the cup is plastic but straw free. I personally find drinks to be better with a straw so this place may not be it for you if that’s a deal breaker. The matcha seemed to be authentically made and the customer service was quick, nothing special
