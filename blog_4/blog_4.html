                    The cafe was crowded and a little more chaotic. Felt like a true cafe spot where the steam wand and water were steaming and making chhhh noises. The customer service was good and they were fast in making my drink. The inside had some seating and was dimmly lit and had high ceilings so it's a great place to study.

            <h3>Flavor</h3>
                <p>
                    The drink had a pretty classic matcha flavor. The sweetener taste a little artificial and boba like but nothing crazy overbearing. This one has a more apparent grass flavor and a bit bitter. The sweetener also sits at the bottom so if you don’t mix it, it’ll be just a big sip of sweet. The flavor profile is on the milder side so much so that you can taste the oat milk equal to the matcha.

                    It had a very dry finish. Pretty thin and watery. I can’t feel the matcha powder but the matcha makes the mouth dryer than other matcha drinks I’ve had. It still smooth and refreshing.

                The matcha is made authentically with a whisk and bowl. It has a strong green color. Mainly a boba and tea store. The menu has a unique design but hard to find cause it’s so high up. Good gradient but I can see matcha particles. There was seating but it was a pretty minimal and small store. There wasn’t any food that I saw that was offered but many different variety of tea drinks. They offer 2 sizes and the price isn’t clearly shown but it was on the cheaper side compared to other stores. The cup and straw was plastic :(. Overall the drink is good for a quick grab and go if you’re out and about in union square.
